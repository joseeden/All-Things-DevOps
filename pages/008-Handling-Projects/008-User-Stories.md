# User Stories



## WHat it is

A user story is a tool used in agile software development to capture a description of a software feature from an end-user perspective.

A user story describes the type of user, what they want, and why.


**What**
It describes a feature (or component of a feature) and is short and simple.

**Who**
It’s from the perspective of the person who will use the feature.

**Why**
It incorporates the “value” of the feature so the team knows what is driving this request.

**When**
User stories are prioritized in terms of when they’ll be completed.

## Good Questions to Ask

* Do the user stories address who needs the product, what they need, and why they need it?
* Do my user stories logically roll up into epics and again into product features?
* Do my user stories include acceptance criteria to validate that we delivered the required value?

## Create User Stories

You and your team will create and capture user stories in a specific format.

> “As a… I want… so that…”.


**As a…**
This describes who the user is. You might design a feature differently if you know that the end user is tech-savvy versus one who is not.

**I want…**
This expresses what the user is trying to accomplish. Understanding the feature request is critical to delivering the right thing.

**So that…**
This is perhaps the most critical part of the user story format. Why the user wants to accomplish something can be very enlightening to the goal just described.

Here’s what a good user story looks like:

> *As a gardener, I want to control greenhouse conditions from my phone, so that my plants will stay happy while I’m away.*
