## Identifying Vulnerabilities

### Vulnerability Scanning 

Automated method of probing networks, systems, and applications to discover potential vulnerabilities.

- Many tools available, including Nessus and OpenVAS.
- These tools can analyze your system's current state against known vulnerabilities.
- They can also generate a detailed report of vulnerabilities and criticality levels.
- Passive/non-invasive, compared to penetration tests.
- Should be ran periodically, either through manual or scheduled manner.

Types:

- **Credentialed Scan**, where host/device credentials is entered to scanning tool.
- **Uncredentialed Scan**, which mimics someone who doesn't have access

As a cybersecurity professional, you need to:

- Prioritize
- Patch
- Mitigate

### Penetration Testing

Used to simulate a real-world attack on a system to evaluate its security posture.

- Attackers are likely to use similar attack vectors and techniques.
- Mitigate the identified issues found in the report.
- To learn more, please see [Penetration Testing.](./050-Audits-and-Assessments.md#penetration-testing)

### Security and Process Auditing

   - Establish ongoing monitoring processes to maintain security and compliance.
   - Document audit findings, actions taken, and future recommendations.

## Responsible Disclosure  

Describes the ethical practice where a security researcher discloses information about vulnerabilities in a software, hardware, or online service in confidential manner to the relevant stakeholders.

- Allow affected party with enough time to address the vulnerability before a public disclosure.
- Researchers contacts the owner/developer privately like sending an email.
- Both parties agrees on a certain timeframe before a disclosure can be made.
- This ensures the vulnerability is not exploited by a threat actor.

### Bug Bounty Programs 

Bug Bounty Programs encourage cybersecurity researchers to find and report vulnerabilities. Monetary rewards can be offered by organizations to incentivized researchers to participate in the organization's disclosure program in a more controlled and ethical manner. It can done:

- Internally

## Prioritize, Classify. and Assess

### Prioritize 
Factors to consider when prioritizing vulnerabilities:

- Ease of exploitation 
- Magnitude of potential damage 
- Importance of affected system

### Classify 
Factors to consider when classifying vulnerabilities:

- Type of threat 
- Potential impact to the organization
- Systems or data that may be affected

Sample categories:

- Software flaws
- Configuration errors 
- Security policy gaps

Within each category, we can further sub-classify them, like:

- Buffer overflows 
- Privilege Escalation
- Insecure default settings 

### CVE

- Each CVE entry includes a brief description of the vulnerability
- May contain references to further details, patches, or advisories

Link: cve.mitre.org

### Assessing Impact 

Vulnerabilities' impact can be assessed in terms of:

- Confidentiality
- Integrity 
- Availability

Impact can also be assessed based on the industy:

- Healthcare Vulnerabilities 
   - Risks patient data and safety.

- Financial Institution Vulnerabilities 
   - Lead to monetary losses and regulatory scrutiny.

## Exposure Factor

Exposure Factor (EF) is a measure used in risk assessment to quantify the potential impact of a security breach on an organization.

- Represents the percentage of asset value lost due to a specific threat
- Used to estimate the financial impact of a security incident
- A key component in calculating the Single Loss Expectancy (SLE)

How to calculate: 

- EF is expressed as a percentage (0% to 100%)
- Determined by evaluating the extent of damage a threat can cause

   ```bash
   EF = Risk of downtime (hours) / 24 hours
   ```

Example:

- If an asset worth 100,000 USD has an EF of 40%, the expected loss from a specific threat would be $40,000.

For more information, please see [Quantitative Risk Assessment.](./003-Risk-Management.md)


## Risk Tolerance

Risk tolerance refers to the level of risk an organization or individual is willing to accept in pursuit of its objectives.

- The amount of uncertainty an organization is prepared to handle
